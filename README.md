# PDF_RC_TyEx
This repository contains a Streamlit-based application that processes PDFs by detecting and classifying different text regions, such as handwritten, typed text, signatures, and noise. It then extracts text from typed regions and structures it into a dictionary, where headers are keys and the text under them forms the body.
